     CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are both layout models in CSS, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features. Here are the main differences between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid:

CSS Flexbox:


One-dimensional vs. Two-dimensional:

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
It's best suited for laying out items in a single direction, allowing them to flex and distribute space along that axis.
Direction:

Flexbox can be used for both rows and columns, allowing for easy arrangement of items in a linear format.
Content Alignment:

It provides properties like justify-content and align-items for aligning items along the main and cross axes, respectively.
Ordering:

Flexbox allows you to change the order of items using the order property.
Responsive Design:

It's particularly useful for creating responsive designs, as items can flex and adjust their sizes based on the available space.


CSS Grid:


Two-dimensional Layout:

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns simultaneously.
Grid Lines:

Grid layout uses lines to define tracks . You can precisely control the size and placement of items in both dimensions.
Alignment:

CSS Grid provides properties like justify-content, align-items, justify-self, and align-self for precise control over the placement of items.
Automatic Row Sizing:

Grid can automatically size rows and columns based on the content or available space using the auto keyword.
Item Placement:

With CSS Grid, you can place items anywhere on the grid, providing a high level of control over the layout.
