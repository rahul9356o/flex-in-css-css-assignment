-justify-content:
This property aligns flex container items along the main axis. It helps in distributing extra free space or shrinking items when there is not enough space.



-align-items: 
This property aligns flex container items along the cross axis. It specifies the default alignment for items inside the flex container.



-gap: 
This property is used to set the gap  between flex container items. It's a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap in a grid layout, and it works similarly in a flex container.



-flex-wrap: 
This property determines whether the flex container should wrap the flex items if they do not fit in a single line. It can have values like nowrap, wrap, and wrap-reverse.
